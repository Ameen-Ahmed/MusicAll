# Song2Search

This is a Node.js and Express web application that allows users to search for songs across multiple media streaming platforms. 

## Supported APIs

The platforms supported by this application, along with their corresponding APIs, are as follows:
- **Spotify**: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
- **Youtube**: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/
- **iTunes**: https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/
- **Audiomack**: https://www.audiomack.com/data-api/docs
- **SoundCloud**: This API is currently unavailable to new applications. Instead, this project uses headless Chromium in the form of the Puppeteer package to search the SoundCloud library. https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer
